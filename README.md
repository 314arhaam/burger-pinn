## Introduction
This work is an implementation of the reference paper above. In this work, a neural network is trained to solve Burgers' equation, a well-known PDE, for a given set of BCs and an IC.  
To train this model, certain number of points on the both boundaries and on the initial timestep were sampled, as input data, called **data points**, to compute MSE loss function, in addition to another set of points on the main domain of the problem, or **collocation points** to penalize the network in case the prediction on this set is not consistent with the governing PDE.

### Problem details
The governing PDE is:

![Burgers' equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cdpi%7B120%7D%20%5Clarge%20%5C%5C%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%7Bu%7D%7D%7B%5Cpartial%7Bt%7D%7D&plus;u%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%7Bu%7D%7D%7B%5Cpartial%7Bx%7D%7D-%28%5Cfrac%7B0.01%7D%7B%5Cpi%7D%29%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2%7Bu%7D%7D%7B%5Cpartial%7Bx%5E2%7D%7D%3D0)

Which is solved in the following spatial and temporal domain:

![0<=t<=1 -1<=x<=+1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cdpi%7B120%7D%20%5Clarge%20%5C%5C%200%5Cleq%7Bt%7D%5Cleq%7B1%7D%20%5C%20%2C%20%5C%20-1%5Cleq%7Bx%7D%5Cleq%7B&plus;1%7D)

Regarding the following initial and boundary conditions:
