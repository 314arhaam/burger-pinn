## Introduction
This work is an implementation of the reference paper above. In this work, a neural network is trained to solve Burgers' equation, a well-known PDE, for a given set of BCs and an IC.  

To train this model, certain number of points on the both boundaries and on the initial timestep were sampled, as input data, called **data points**, to compute MSE loss function, in addition to another set of points on the main domain of the problem, or **collocation points** to penalize the network in case the prediction on this set is not consistent with the governing PDE.

### Problem details
The governing PDE is:

### $\partial_{t}{u}+u\partial_{x}{u}-(\frac{0.01}{\pi})\partial_{xx}{u} = 0$

Which is solved in the following spatial and temporal domain:

### $D = \\{ (t, x)\ |\ 0\le t \le +1 \land -1\le x \le +1 \\}$

Regarding the following initial and boundary conditions:

$$
\begin{equation}
  \begin{cases}
    u(0, x) = -\sin({\pi x})\\
    u(t, +1) = 0.0 \\
    u(t, -1) = 0.0 \\  
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$
